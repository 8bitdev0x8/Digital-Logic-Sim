Some notes to keep track of how things work

Overview:
Every electrical component has one or more 'terminals'. These are points at which wires can be attached.
Each frame, the simulation script is run, which first increments the simulationFrame counter, and then tells each power source to emit power.
To emit power, a power source simply calls the receive power function on its single terminal.

When a terminal receives power it goes through its list of connected wires, and calls the receive power function on the terminal
on the other end of the wire. To avoid processing the same terminal multiple times (help performance, say no to infinite loops), each
terminal keeps track of the simulation frame on which it received power, and won't do any processing if it has already received power
on the current simulation frame.

Some terminals terminate at an electrica compoenent. In this case, the terminal simply submits to the component that it has received power,
and the component is then responsible for acting on that information.

For example, a relay switch component will need to wait until it has received both a power input and a control signal input
(on the current simulation frame), before it calls the receive power function on the power terminals.

Built-in chips vs custom chip types created at run-time:
â€¢ Built-in chips are instantiated from prefabs, but new chip types created at runtime are just stored as hidden objects in the scene
